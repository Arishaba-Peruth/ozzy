#syntax about variable names in python
#a name given to a partition through programming is called variable.
num1 = 65 #num1 is a variable
num2 = 100 #num2 is a variable
print(num1)
print(num2)
print(num1 + num2)
#the name of the variable should not start with a numeral or number e.g 1num or 2num
#a variable name should not start with a special character e.g @num, &num, !num
#compound variable names should not have spaces e.g num 1, num 2, my num
#compound variable names should be joined by either an underscore or camel case or camel notation e.g my_num, num_1, myNum(this is called camel notation)
#avoid using capital letters to begin a variable name e.g Num1, Num2
#dont use special words as variable names e.g print, input, for etc
#variables in python are case senstive e.g Num1 is different from num1
#a complete instruction to a computer is called a statement e.g 3,4,5,6
#a statement that gives us a result is called an expression e.g line 6
#a python file is called a python script
#a group of statements is called a code
#a group of related code is called a block
#a block of code in a python script is called a program
#the running or implementing of a program is called execution
